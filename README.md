# Dockit

Dockit is a documentation generator, inspired by [docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/),
written in Literate Javascript. It produces a set of HTML documents that display your comments
intermingled with your code, for your entire project.

All prose is passed through Markdown, and code is passed through Highlight.js syntax highlighting.
This page is the result of running Dockit against its own source files.


## Installation

    npm install -g dockit

## Usage

Run inside a directory with a `.dockit.json5` file or pass the location as a command
line option, see `dockit --help`
